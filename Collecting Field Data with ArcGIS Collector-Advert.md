# Collecting Field Data with ArcGIS Collector

**ArcGIS Online** is becoming the fully functional online GIS that it has always promised. This workshop is designed as an introduction to **ArcGIS.com** and **Collector for ArcGIS**, and assumes some familiarity with spatial data and basic GIS terminology.  Participants will explore a  workflow for creating and managing multi-user spatial field data collection projects using nothing but a browser and consumer-grade mobile phones (iOS or Android). 

Participants will learn to:  

* Create empty "feature classes" to hold spatial data
* Customize the data schema to the field data need
* Create "Lists" to drive in-app dropdown menus for controlled vocabularies and standardization
* Customize field survey forms for usability
* Enable attachments (such as audio, video or images)
* Enable offline, "disconnected" editing, for remote, off-network, data collection
* Deploy a field data collection app from ArcGIS.com to iOS or Android devices with the Collector app installed
* Share the app and editing role to a controlled group of users
* Download the field data collection app and basemap for offline use 
* Collect data and sync to the ArcGIS.com database
* Create a simple read-only view of the live data, for monitoring data collection
* Export the data to multiple formats

By the end of the workshop, participants should be familiar enough to create their own field data collection applications, customized to their research needs. 

Participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops and mobile devices, with **Collector for ArcGIS installed**, to the workshop.
